Chosen Data: 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey dataset which includes data on 3,787 people such as race, sex, height, 
weight, BMI, and whether or not they are obese.  We plan to take the data and try to visualize which factors effect health in terms of obesity.
The data is from https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/national-health-and-nutrition-examination-survey
